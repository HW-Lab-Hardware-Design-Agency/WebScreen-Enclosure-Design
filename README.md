# WebScreen-Enclosure-Design
## Description

This repository contains design files and technical documentation for the webscreen enclosure. The enclosure has been designed to provide a robust and functional solution, optimizing hardware integration with an improved fastening system using insertion and friction instead of adhesives.

## Main Features

+ Optimized Design: Fastening via insertion and friction for greater stability and easy assembly.

+ Compatibility: Specifically designed for the webscreen with a custom support base.

+ Recommended Materials: `PLA`, `ABS`, depending on mechanical and thermal resistance requirements.

+ Source Files: Models in [Freecad](https://www.freecad.org/) format.

## Project structure
  • `/Documentation` - Contains the technical manual with specifications and assembly guides..

  • `/STL_Files` - contains design files in .STL formats for 3D printing.

  • `/Editable_files_in_Freecad` - contains design files in .FCStd formats for 3D edition in [Freecad](https://www.freecad.org/).

## Assembly Instructions
  • Watch the [assembly instructions video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHH5L84EN5o&t=1s).

  • You can also find a detailed [guide to fix the webscreen](https://es.ifixit.com/Desmontaje/WebScreen+Teardown/181334).


## 3D Printing Specifications for WebScreen
To ensure optimal quality and functionality, please follow these printing settings:

  • Layer height: 0.2 mm
  
  • Infill density: 20%
  
  • Infill pattern: Gyroid or Grid (for strength and flexibility)
  
  • Wall thickness: 1.2 mm (at least 3 perimeters)
  
  • Top/bottom layers: 4
  
  • Printing material: PLA, PETG, or ABS (PETG recommended for better durability)
  
  • Nozzle diameter: 0.4 mm
  
  • Print speed: 50-60 mm/s
  
  • Supports: Only if necessary (use tree supports for easy removal)
  
  • Bed adhesion: Brim or Raft if necessary (for better grip)
  
  • Cooling fan: 100% (except for the first few layers)
  
  • Temperature Nozzle: 200-220°C (depending on material)
  
  • Temperature Bed: 60°C for PLA, 80°C for PETG, 100°C for ABS

Make sure your print bed is well-leveled, and the first layer adheres properly to avoid warping. If using ABS, print in an enclosed chamber to prevent warping and cracking.
For best results, post-processing such as light sanding or acetone smoothing (for ABS) can be applied.
